/* This is an implementation of HyperLogLog algorithm as described in the
 * paper "HyperLogLog: the analysis of near-optimal cardinality estimation
 * algorithm", published by Flajolet, Fusy, Gandouet and Meunier in 2007.
 * Generally it is an improved version of LogLog algorithm with the last
 * step modified, to combine the parts using harmonic means.
 *
 * Several improvements have been included that are described in "HyperLogLog 
 * in Practice: Algorithmic Engineering of a State of The Art Cardinality 
 * Estimation Algorithm", published by Stefan Heulem, Marc Nunkesse and 
 * Alexander Hall.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * -------------------------- DEFINED CONSTANTS ------------------------------
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * ERROR_CONST = 1.04*1.04
 * 
 * 	Used in calculating the minimum m for a desired error_rate. Derived from 
 * 	error_rate = 1.04/sqrt(m)
 * 	sqrt(m) = 1.04/error_rate
 * 	m = (1.04/error_rate)^2
 * 	m = 1.0816/(error_rate*error_rate) 
 *
 * MIN_INDEX_BITS no real sense in being as inaccurate as <4 values would be
 * (>35%)
 *
 * MAX_INDEX_BITS error correction data only goes up to 18
 *
 * HASH_LENGTH the version of MurmurHash we use produces 64 bit hashes 
 *
 * HASH_SEED a random seed for the hash function to use
 *
 * MAX_INTERPOLATION_POINTS any precision (# index bits) above 5 has 200
 * points
 *
 * PRECISION_5_MAX_INTERPOLATION_POINTS precision 5 only has 159 points
 *
 * PRECISION_4_MAX_INTERPOLATION_POINTS precision 4 only has 79 points 
 * 
 * STRUCT_VERSION
 * 0 - Basic implementation + compression and H++'s improved error correction
 * at low cardinalities
 *
 * 1 - Sparse encoding added for low cardinalities. Improves accuracy and
 * storage for low cardinalities.
 *
 * 2 - Sparse compression added. */
